# Dossier v0.5.0

**Pre-release.** For local and development use only. Authentication and RLS are not yet in place ([ADR 0007](https://github.com/rwliebs/Dossier/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-release-gate-auth-rls-required.md)); production deployment is gated until those are complete.

## Try it

**One-shot run:**

```bash
npx dossier-agentic-product-planner-builder
```

**Or clone and run:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rwliebs/Dossier.git
cd Dossier
git checkout v0.5.0
pnpm install && pnpm run build && pnpm run dossier
```

---

Your browser will open to http://localhost:3000. On first run you'll be guided through API key setup, or go to `/setup`.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/). A [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope is needed only if you want agents to open PRs; agents can write files locally without it.

## What's in this release

- **Product map** — Create and edit projects; add workflows and feature cards; manage cards with requirements, facts, assumptions, questions, and linked context.
- **Planning agent** — Chat to infer workflows from a connected repo and README; populate the map with activities and cards.
- **Approval** — Per-card approve with generated context packages and E2E test specs; planned files and context documents attached to cards.
- **Build orchestration** — Trigger builds per card or workflow; feature branches per attempt; agentic-flow execution; run status, checks, and PR lifecycle (GitHub optional for local file writes).
- **Repository integration** — Connect a GitHub repo (optional); select files for context; file tree and diff status in the UI.
- **Context documents** — Add and edit FILES and DOCS via the agent in chat; surface to agents at build time.
- **Local-first** — All product and run state in SQLite under `~/.dossier/`; no data leaves your machine except via your Anthropic and (if used) GitHub connection.
