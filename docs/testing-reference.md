# Testing Reference

**Anchors**: [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md), [user-workflows-reference.md](product/user-workflows-reference.md)

## Contract

- INVARIANT: Tests use Vitest; jsdom for React components
- INVARIANT: Contract and integration tests are source of truth; E2E augments
- INVARIANT: DB tests use in-memory SQLite or mock adapter
- INVARIANT: Tests assert product outcomes from user-workflows-reference.md and user-stories.md

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run test` | Run full suite once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Coverage report (v8) |
| `npm run test:planning` | Planning LLM tests (mock allowed) |
| `npm run test:planning:e2e` | Planning E2E (trading card marketplace) |
| `npm run test:e2e:project-to-cards` | Full flow: create project → idea → cards for 2+ workflows |
| `npm run test:e2e:adaptive` | Adaptive E2E flows |
| `npm run test:db` | DB adapter and migration tests |

## Patterns

### Mock DbAdapter
- Use `lib/mock-db-adapter.ts` for unit tests that need DB
- In-memory SQLite for integration tests via `createTestDb()` (when available)

### Planning LLM Tests
- Set `PLANNING_MOCK_ALLOWED=1` to skip real API calls
- Use `__tests__/llm/planning-fixtures.ts` for gold/adversarial examples

### Component Tests
- `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`
- `setup.ts` imports `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest`

### Coverage
- Provider: v8
- Reporters: text, html
- Run `npm run test:coverage` for report

## Product Outcome Alignment

Tests assert the following product invariants (from user-workflows-reference.md):

| Outcome | Test Location |
|--------|---------------|
| Build requires finalized_at + approved planned files | `trigger-build.test.ts` |
| Build rejects when card(s) lack finalized_at | `trigger-build.test.ts` |
| Build rejects when no cards have approved planned files | `trigger-build.test.ts` |
| artifact_kind excludes test (tests live as ContextArtifact type:test) | `slice-b.test.ts` |
| Per-card finalize validates requirements + planned files; sets finalized_at | `finalize.test.ts` |
| E2E: build-ready = approved planned files + finalized | `project-to-cards-flow.test.ts` |

## Verification
- [ ] All tests pass before commit
- [ ] Contract tests cover schema and action validation
- [ ] Integration tests cover API and orchestration boundaries
- [ ] Product outcome alignment table reflects current coverage
